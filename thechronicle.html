    <h1>The Chronicle begins...</h1>
   <div class="no">
    <p>In the beginning, there was only the void. A vast emptiness that stretched infinitely in all directions. But from this void, a spark ignited, and with it, the first light emerged.</p>
    <p>As the light spread, it began to form shapes and patterns. The first creatures emerged, small and fragile, with eyes that sparkled with a primal curiosity. They wandered the void, seeking knowledge and understanding.</p>
    <p>Time passed, and the creatures grew in number and complexity. They built great civilizations, each one striving to outdo the last. They created art, music, and stories that echoed through the ages.</p>
    <p>But with progress came conflict. The civilizations clashed, their ambitions leading to wars that shook the very fabric of existence. The void trembled as the light flickered, threatened by the darkness that crept in.</p>
    <p>they have been in a bloody war for eons, your quest is to end the fighting once and for all</p>
    <p>good luck....</p>
